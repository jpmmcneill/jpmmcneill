**Hi there** ðŸ‘‹

I'm James (he/him), from Dublin in Ireland. I studied Theoretical Physics in Trinity College Dublin. I am interested in Applied Math and Game theory - particularly in relation to Ecology. I'd love to do a PhD in this area at some point, if the stars align ðŸ˜„.

I currently work in a Quant Research department for a trading company.

I have worked at:
- [CRH](https://crh.com/), Mostly Investor relations
- [Conjura](https://conjura.com/), Analytics, Product Lead & Engineering Manager

There are some open source items that I have worked / am working on:
- A Universal Semantic Layer (still private, slow WIP with a friend of mine)
- DBT (I've used it a lot, have a love/hate relationship with it, am a package maintainer, and have been invovled with the duckdb adapter)
- PuffinDB (mostly giving product guidance)
- Pypulation, a python library for population dynamics (it's too basic to be useful right now)

And a few ideas I have for the future:
- A SQL supporting data lake powered by single table design on dynamoDB (not designed to be useful)
- Opinionated SQL linter for building sensible sql pipelines
- DuckDB extension for FMRI data
